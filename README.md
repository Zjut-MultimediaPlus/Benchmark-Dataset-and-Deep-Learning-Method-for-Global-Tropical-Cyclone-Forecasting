![Dataset Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/792867ad-5ea4-49c8-beb9-267276de7aec)
This repository introduces the contents of our research work, which consists of **two main parts**:

1. A benchmark dataset for global tropical cyclone (TC) research – **TropiCycloneNet Dataset**
2. A deep learning-based method for predicting TC track and intensity – **TropiCycloneNet Method**

Both parts are released to foster open research and encourage reproducible results in the field of tropical cyclone forecasting.

### 🔍 Overview

The **TropiCycloneNet Dataset** (`TCN_D`) is a comprehensive dataset designed for studying tropical cyclones worldwide. It spans from 1950 to 2023 and includes:

- `Data_1d`: Tabular records of cyclone center location, pressure, wind speed, etc.
- `Data_3d`: Gridded meteorological fields (e.g., geopotential height, wind components, SST) around the cyclone center.
- `Env-Data`: Structured environmental features that support deep learning applications.

It enables the analysis and modeling of both spatial and temporal cyclone behavior and provides a foundation for building data-driven forecasting systems.

### 📥 Download

We offer two download options:

- **[Full Dataset (1950–2023, ~25.7GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BUAab0OYyiArbraQHu2oMoj_jF-nNUxT/view?usp=sharing)**
- **[Test Subset (2017–2023, ~3.34GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xx2rzH6ztSGLTUR9EZkfDz5mQHsvhHsi/view?usp=sharing)**

### 📊 Visualization

We provide easy-to-use scripts for loading and visualizing each part of the dataset (`read_TCND.py`). You can generate visualizations of `Data_1d`, `Data_3d`, and `Env-Data` with a single command.

Example:

```bash
python read_TCND.py dataset_path Haiyan 2001101418 WP train
```
This will produce three images showing the meteorological and environmental context of Typhoon Haiyan at a specific timestamp.
